Paragraphs = {
    'Amphibolite': "Amphibolite is a dark, heavy, metamorphic rock primarily composed of amphibole minerals and plagioclase feldspar, often exhibiting a banded texture. It forms under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, typically in regions with significant tectonic activity. Amphibolite is commonly found in mountain ranges and is valued for its durability, often used as a construction material or decorative stone in landscaping. It is generally not rare and is often sold for $10 to $50 per ton, depending on quality and location.",
    'Acanthite': "Acanthite is a silver sulfide mineral (Agâ‚‚S) that typically forms in a monoclinic crystal system. It is an important ore of silver and is known for its metallic luster and dark gray color. Acanthite is often found in hydrothermal veins and is valued in the mineral collecting community for its rarity. Prices can range from $5 to $100 per ounce, depending on purity and market demand.",
    'apatite': "Apatite is a group of phosphate minerals that come in a variety of colors, including green, blue, and brown. It is commonly found in igneous rocks and is an essential mineral for producing phosphate fertilizers. Apatite is relatively common and affordable, often used as a gemstone.",

    'calcite': "Calcite is a widespread carbonate mineral that forms in a variety of geological environments. It's recognized for its rhombohedral crystal form and reacts with acid by effervescing. Calcite is common and inexpensive, used in the production of cement and lime.",
    'carbonaceous phyllite': "Carbonaceous phyllite is a type of low-grade metamorphic rock rich in carbonaceous material, giving it a dark color. It forms under moderate pressure and temperature conditions and is commonly found in orogenic belts. Its rarity and value are moderate, depending on its specific carbon content.",
    'carbonaceous schists': "Carbonaceous schists are metamorphic rocks that are rich in carbonaceous material, giving them a distinct dark color. They form under high pressure and temperature, often in regions of significant tectonic activity. These rocks are relatively rare and can be of interest to geologists for their unique formation history.",
    'carbonaceous schists gnesis': "Carbonaceous schists gneiss is a high-grade metamorphic rock characterized by a banded appearance and significant carbonaceous content. It forms under intense heat and pressure conditions, typically in deep crustal environments. This rock type is rare and often studied for its complex geological history.",
    'cerussite': "Cerussite is a lead carbonate mineral that forms in the oxidized zones of lead ore deposits. It's known for its high density and bright luster, often used as a lead ore. Cerussite is moderately rare and can be quite valuable, especially in well-formed crystals.",
    'chrysocolla': "Chrysocolla is a hydrated copper silicate mineral known for its bright blue-green color. It forms in the oxidized zones of copper deposits and is often used as a gemstone. Chrysocolla is moderately rare and can vary in price depending on the quality of the specimen.",
    'copper': "Copper is a native element and metal that is highly conductive and malleable. It is found in various geological settings, often in association with other copper minerals like azurite and bornite. Copper is relatively abundant and widely used in electrical wiring and other applications.",
    'corundum': "Corundum is a crystalline form of aluminum oxide and is one of the hardest minerals, second only to diamond. It comes in various colors, with red corundum known as ruby and blue as sapphire. Corundum is valuable and can be extremely rare depending on color and clarity.",
    'fluorite': "Fluorite is a colorful mineral composed of calcium fluoride, often forming in hydrothermal veins. It is known for its cubic crystals and is used in the production of fluorine and as a flux in steelmaking. Fluorite is moderately common and relatively affordable, though high-quality specimens can be valuable.",
    'gypsum': "Gypsum is a soft sulfate mineral widely used in construction, especially in the production of plaster and drywall. It forms in evaporite deposits and is known for its flexibility and ability to form in large crystals. Gypsum is abundant and inexpensive.",
    'hematite': "Hematite is an iron oxide mineral that is the primary ore of iron. It forms in various geological environments and is recognized for its metallic luster and reddish streak. Hematite is common and widely used in the steel industry, making it relatively affordable.",
    'malachite': "Malachite is a copper carbonate mineral known for its vivid green color and banded patterns. It forms in the oxidized zones of copper deposits and is often used as a gemstone or decorative stone. Malachite is moderately rare and can be quite expensive, especially in high-quality specimens.",
    'muscovite': "Muscovite is a common mica mineral that is highly flexible and can be split into thin sheets. It forms in igneous and metamorphic rocks and is used in the electrical and construction industries. Muscovite is abundant and inexpensive.",
    'orthoclase': "Orthoclase is a feldspar mineral that commonly forms in igneous rocks like granite. It is known for its pink to white color and is used in the production of ceramics and glass. Orthoclase is relatively common and affordable.",
